## Description

First of all, a Shell in computing, is a computer program wich exposes an operating system's services to a human user or another program. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line inferface (CLI) or graphical user inferface (GUI), depending on computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

We used Bash as our Shell father to execute our own Shell program made in C. Our Shell can handle those following tasks:
- Start reading a file  with:
    >[filename] ./hsh
- Start by 'echo' output:
    > echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
- Uses the PATH environment variable
- Built-ins commands
- Special characters like:
    > ", ', `, \, *, &, #
- Commands with arguments
- Exit built-in with arguments
- Ctrl+C shortcut
- View, Set and Unset environmental variables
- cd command
- ; command separator
